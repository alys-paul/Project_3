# Project_3
Trip Fare : Predicting Urban Taxi Fare with Machine Learning

# Taxi Fare Prediction ðŸšš

This mini-project is a web application for predicting NYC taxi fares based on pickup/dropoff coordinates, passenger count, and trip time. It uses a trained ML model and runs entirely on Google Colab using Streamlit + ngrok, so no local setup is required.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

`taxi_data.csv` contains historical NYC taxi trip data:

* Pickup/Dropoff coordinates
* Passenger count
* Fare details (tip, tax, etc.)
* Datetime & vendor info

---
## ðŸ“¦ Features
* Estimate fare based on trip distance and time

* User-friendly web UI with Streamlit

* Hosted from Colab via public ngrok link

* Supports .pkl models trained with scikit-learn, xgboost, and pandas

## ðŸ’» Streamlit App 

## ðŸ§ª How to Run in Google Colab
* Open the Colab notebook.

* Run each cell step-by-step:

* Install dependencies

* Upload your trained model (taxi_fare_predictor.pkl)

* Auto-generate the app.py file (Streamlit code)

* Launch app with ngrok (public link appears)

* Click the ngrok link printed in the final cell to access your live app.

## ðŸ’¡ Inputs in the App
* Pickup Date and Time

* Pickup Latitude & Longitude

* Dropoff Latitude & Longitude

* Passenger Count

## ðŸ“ˆ Output
* Predicted Fare in USD based on the input trip

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies
Ensure the following versions were used to train your model (for compatibility):

```bash
scikit-learn==1.6.1  
xgboost==3.0.3  
pandas==2.2.2  
streamlit  
pyngrok  
cloudpickle  
```
